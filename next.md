remove the inter-app dependency imports; like the one from the account.serializers to util.fields






# the qwen next thing:

Here are my suggestions for what to focus on next, in a recommended order:

1.  **Implement the `assessment` App Core Logic:**
    *   **Data Population:** Add the remaining JSON files for all required assessments (Swanson, Gardner, PVQ, Holland, MBTI, NEO, Disc, Creativity) into `service-backend/assessment/data/`.
    *   **Admin Data Entry:** Use the Django Admin panel to create the `TestPackage` instances (Kids, Teenagers, Young People, Adults) and then create `Assessment` instances, linking them to the appropriate packages via the `TestPackage.assessments` M2M field. This verifies the model relationships work correctly.
    *   **API Endpoints:** Implement the views and serializers in `assessment/views.py` and `assessment/serializers.py` to allow users to:
        *   List available packages (filtered by age).
        *   List assessments within a purchased package.
        *   Start an assessment attempt.
        *   Submit answers/results for an assessment.
        *   View their own past results.
    *   **Permissions:** Ensure that users can only access packages appropriate for their age and only start/access assessments within packages they have purchased.

2.  **Implement JWT Authentication Flow:**
    *   **Testing Login/Registration API:** Ensure the registration (`/api/account/register/`) and JWT login (`/api/token/`) endpoints work correctly. Users should be able to register with National Code and Phone Number, log in, and receive `access` and `refresh` tokens.
    *   **Protecting Assessment Endpoints:** Apply the necessary authentication and permission classes to the `assessment` API views so that only authenticated users can access them. This verifies the JWT setup is working for protecting resources.

3.  **Set Up Celery and Redis:**
    *   **Configuration:** Add Celery and Redis configuration to `core/settings.py`. This typically involves setting `CELERY_BROKER_URL` and `CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND` to point to your Redis instance (e.g., `redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0`).
    *   **Celery App:** Create a `celery.py` file in the `core` project directory to configure the Celery application instance.
    *   **Docker (Optional but Recommended):** If you plan to use Docker, add a `redis` service to your `docker-compose.yml` file.
    *   **Testing:** Once configured, you can test the setup by running the Celery worker (`celery -A core worker -l info`) and potentially adding a simple test task.

4.  **Integrate Payment Gateway (ZarinPal - Placeholder):**
    *   **Settings:** Ensure `ZARINPAL_MERCHANT_ID` and related settings are correctly configured in `settings.py`.
    *   **Service Logic:** Create a basic service function in `util/services.py` or a new `payments` app to interact with the ZarinPal API (request, verify). This can initially use mocked responses or direct API calls for testing the flow logic.
    *   **Views:** Create views in `assessment/views.py` (or a new `payments` app) to handle initiating the purchase process and the callback/verification endpoint.

5.  **Develop the `ai_integration` App Interaction:**
    *   **Service Stub:** Implement the `ai_integration/services.py` to make a basic request to the (locally hosted) DeepSeek API. This might initially be a placeholder or a call to a mock service.
    *   **Celery Task:** Implement the Celery task in `assessment/tasks.py` that gets triggered when a user completes an assessment. This task should gather the user's results, format them, and call the `ai_integration` service.
    *   **AI Response Task:** Implement the Celery task in `ai_integration/tasks.py` to receive the AI's response and save it as `AIRecommendation` objects.

By focusing on these areas, you build the core functionality pipeline: User Authentication -> Access/Purchase Assessments -> Take Assessments -> Process Results (Background) -> Get AI Recommendations. This creates a solid backbone for the platform before moving on to features like resume building or counseling, which depend on having user profiles and assessment data.
